# TypeScript & Bun Refactoring Workflow

Please help refactor my TypeScript/Bun codebase with the following steps:

1. **Eliminate redundancy**
   - Remove duplicate types, interfaces, and utility functions
   - Consolidate similar functionality into shared helpers
   - Apply DRY principles with TypeScript generics and utility types
   - Extract common patterns into reusable TypeScript modules
   - Remove dead code with TypeScript's unused variable detection
   - Implement proper caching with Bun's performance APIs

2. **Improve code architecture**
   - Leverage TypeScript's type system:
     - Use functional patterns for data transformations
     - Create pure functions with explicit return types
     - Use TypeScript interfaces for clear contracts
     - Implement proper type narrowing with type guards
     - Apply utility types (Pick, Omit, Partial) for flexibility

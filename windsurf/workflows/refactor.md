# TypeScript & Bun Refactoring Workflow

Please help refactor my TypeScript/Bun codebase with the following steps:

1. **Eliminate redundancy**
   - Remove duplicate types, interfaces, and utility functions
   - Consolidate similar functionality into shared helpers
   - Apply DRY principles with TypeScript generics and utility types
   - Extract common patterns into reusable TypeScript modules
   - Remove dead code with TypeScript's unused variable detection
   - Implement proper caching with Bun's performance APIs
   - Merge overlapping type definitions into unified interfaces

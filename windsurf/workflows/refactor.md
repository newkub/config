# Code Refactoring Workflow

Please help refactor my code with the following steps:

1. **Eliminate redundancy**
   - Remove duplicate variables, functions, and logic
   - Consolidate similar functionality
   - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

2. **Improve code architecture**
   - Convert to functional programming style where appropriate
   - Extract reusable functions and components
   - Apply proper separation of concerns
   - Use types and interfaces instead of inline definitions

3. **Optimize structure**
   - Split into separate files with clear responsibilities
   - Organize related functionality into modules

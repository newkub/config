# Bun TypeScript CLI Development Guide

This guide outlines best practices for building high-performance command-line interfaces with Bun and TypeScript.

## 1. Project Setup

- **Core Dependencies**
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@clack/prompts": "^0.7.0",
    "commander": "^11.1.0",
    "execa": "^8.0.1",
    "picocolors": "^1.0.0"
  }
  ```

- **Development Environment**
  ```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@biomejs/biome": "^1.4.1",
    "@types/bun": "^1.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^20.10.0",
    "typescript": "^5.3.0",
    "bun-types": "latest"
  }
  ```

- **Workflow Scripts**
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "bun run --watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "bun build src/index.ts --target node --outdir dist",
    "start": "bun run dist/index.js",
    "test": "bun test",
    "test:watch": "bun test --watch",
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "lint:fix": "biome check --apply .",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "format": "biome format --write ."
  }
  ```

## 2. TypeScript Best Practices

- Create branded types for type-safe identifiers
- Use discriminated unions for state management
- Implement utility types for common operations
- Apply readonly modifiers to prevent mutations
- Leverage template literal types for string validation

## 3. Bun Performance Optimizations

- Utilize Bun's fast startup for responsive CLI tools
- Implement Bun.file() for efficient file handling
- Use Bun.serve() for lightweight API services
- Leverage built-in SQLite for persistent storage
- Apply Bun.password for secure credential management

## 4. CLI Architecture

- Structure commands with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Create pure utility functions with explicit types
- Separate business logic from command handling
- Implement consistent error handling patterns
- Build modular design with clear responsibilities

## 5. Code Quality

- Extract common patterns into shared utilities
- Eliminate duplicated code through abstraction
- Organize by feature rather than technical layer
- Use path aliases for cleaner imports
- Apply consistent naming conventions

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Leverage Bun's fast test runner
- Create typed test fixtures and factories
- Apply dependency injection for testability
- Write pure functions for deterministic tests
- Implement proper mocking strategies

## 7. Performance Considerations

- Use async/await patterns efficiently
- Optimize resource usage and memory management
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Apply proper error handling with Result types
- Leverage modern TypeScript features for safety

# Bun, Vue, TypeScript & UnoCSS Refactoring Workflow

Please help refactor my codebase with the following steps:

1. **Eliminate redundancy**
   - Remove duplicate types, interfaces, and utility functions
   - Consolidate similar functionality into shared Vue composables
   - Apply DRY principles with TypeScript generics and utility types
   - Extract common patterns into reusable TypeScript modules
   - Remove dead code with TypeScript's unused variable detection

# Bun, Vue, TypeScript & UnoCSS Refactoring Workflow

Please help refactor my codebase with the following steps:

1. **Eliminate redundancy**
   - Remove duplicate types, interfaces, and utility functions
   - Consolidate similar functionality into shared Vue composables
   - Apply DRY principles with TypeScript generics and utility types
   - Extract common patterns into reusable TypeScript modules
   - Remove dead code with TypeScript's unused variable detection
   - Implement proper caching with Bun's performance APIs
   - Merge overlapping type definitions into unified interfaces
   - Use TypeScript's module augmentation for extending Vue types
   - Replace repetitive type assertions with custom type guards
   - Implement memoization for expensive computations
   - Refactor similar conditional logic into parameterized functions
   - Extract repeated UnoCSS patterns into custom utilities

2. **Improve code architecture**
   - Leverage TypeScript's type system:
     - Use Vue's Composition API with proper typing
     - Create pure functions with explicit return types
     - Use TypeScript interfaces for Vue component props
     - Implement proper type narrowing with type guards

# Best Project Structure Setup Guide

## 1. Initial Project Setup
- Choose appropriate build tools and package managers (npm, yarn, bun)
- Initialize version control (git)
- Set up .gitignore with proper patterns
- Create a comprehensive README.md

## 2. Directory Organization
- Separate source code (src/) from build artifacts (dist/, build/)
- Organize by feature or module rather than by file type
- Keep configuration files at root level

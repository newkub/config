# Best Project Structure Setup Guide

## 1. Initial Project Setup
- Choose appropriate build tools and package managers (npm, yarn, bun)
- Initialize version control (git)
- Set up .gitignore with proper patterns
- Create a comprehensive README.md

## 2. Directory Organization
- Separate source code (src/) from build artifacts (dist/, build/)
- Organize by feature or module rather than by file type
- Keep configuration files at root level
- Use consistent naming conventions (kebab-case or camelCase)

## 3. Code Structure
- Implement modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Create shared utilities and components folders
- Maintain consistent import/export patterns
- Define clear interfaces between modules

## 4. Configuration
- Set up linting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Configure build and bundling tools
- Add type checking (TypeScript)
- Create environment-specific configurations (.env files)

## 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up unit testing framework
- Implement integration tests
- Add end-to-end testing capabilities
- Configure test coverage reporting

## 6. Documentation
- Document architecture decisions
- Create API documentation
- Include usage examples
- Maintain a changelog

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up continuous integration
- Configure automated testing
- Implement deployment workflows
